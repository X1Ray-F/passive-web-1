Travelers to the United States want wide coverage, predictable data speeds, and simple activation. Here are the leading eSIM options for 2026, what they cost, and how to set them up in a few minutes.

## Quick picks
- Best balance of price + coverage: regional MVNOs riding AT&T or T-Mobile with fair-use caps.
- Fastest in cities: T-Mobile-backed plans with 5G access.
- Long road trips: AT&T-backed plans often keep LTE in rural areas.

### Provider snapshot (Feb 2026)

| Provider (reseller) | Network | Popular plan | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Airalo "Minga" | AT&T | 5 GB / 10 days | Good rural LTE; hotspot allowed |
| Holafly USA | T-Mobile | Unlimited* / 15 days | *Fair-use ~2–3 Mbps after high usage |

| US Mobile eSIM trial | Verizon/T-Mobile | 3 GB / 10 days | Strong urban 5G; check device list |

## APN basics
Most providers push APN automatically. If you need to enter it manually:
- AT&T-based plans: `broadband` or as provided in the email.
- T-Mobile-based plans: usually `fast.t-mobile.com`.
- Leave username/password blank; set APN type to `default,supl` if prompted.

## Compatible devices
- Recent iPhone (XS and newer), Google Pixel 4 and newer, Samsung S22/S23/S24 series, many newer OnePlus.
- Dual-SIM works: keep your home SIM for calls, eSIM for data.
- If your phone was carrier-locked, confirm it’s unlocked before travel.

## Activation steps (5 minutes)
1) Buy the plan and open the QR code on a second screen or print it.
2) On iOS: Settings → Cellular → Add eSIM. On Android: Network → SIMs → Download a SIM.
3) Scan the QR, name it “USA Data”, set it as data line; keep your home SIM for calls.
4) Turn on data roaming for the eSIM; leave it off for your home SIM.
5) Test speed with a maps app; if slow, toggle airplane mode once.

### Speed and fair-use tips
- Heavy tethering can trigger speed caps; use it sparingly.
- In stadiums or events, all networks slow; download offline maps first.
- For national parks, cached maps plus an AT&T-backed plan are safest.

## When to pick unlimited vs. capped
- Choose capped (5–10 GB) if you mainly navigate, message, and browse.
- Choose “unlimited” only if you understand the fair-use throttle; many drop to 2–3 Mbps.
- Combine with Wi‑Fi in hotels/coffee shops to stay under any cap.
