title: Content Calendar Template (Notion)
description: Plan weekly content with statuses, owners, and due dates using Notion.
slug: content-calendar-notion

A lightweight Notion content calendar keeps solo creators and tiny teams on track without turning into a PM monster. This template focuses on fields that matter for publishing speed: status, owner, due date, channel, and a short creative brief.

## What the template includes
- Database view with Status (Idea, Drafting, Editing, Scheduled, Published).
- Owner, Due date, and Channel (Blog, LinkedIn, X, Newsletter, YouTube Short).
- Effort estimate (S, M, L) to avoid overloading a week.
- SEO snippet fields: target keyword, meta title/description.
- Assets checklist: hero image, alt text, CTA link, UTM parameters.

### Suggested fields

| Field | Type | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status | Select | Lets you filter to only what’s blocking you |
| Owner | Person/text | Keeps accountability visible |
| Due date | Date | Drives reminders and calendar sync |
| Channel | Select | Adapts copy length and assets per channel |
| Keyword | Text | Keeps SEO focus tight |
| CTA link | URL | Ensures every post drives to a product or lead form |

## Filters and views for teams of one
- **Today view:** filter where Due date = today OR Status is Drafting/Editing.
- **Week board:** Kanban grouped by Status; shows only the next 7 days.
- **Evergreen list:** filter where Channel = Blog and Status = Published.
- **Assets missing:** filter where Assets checklist is incomplete.

### Quick workflow
1) Dump ideas into Status = Idea with a one-line angle.
2) Each Friday, pick 3–5 items for next week; set Due dates and Owners.
3) Move to Drafting; add target keyword and CTA.
4) When Scheduled, paste the scheduled link or platform ID.
5) After publishing, duplicate to other channels with tailored hooks.

## Tips for a one-person team
- Limit weekly “M” tasks to 3; everything else must be “S”.
- Reuse intros and CTAs across channels; only hooks and length differ.
- Keep a small library of reusable CTAs pointing to your Products page or lead magnet.
- Batch image creation once per week to avoid context switching.

### Asset checklist to avoid launch delays

| Asset | Owner | Done? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hero/thumbnail | You | ☐ |
| Alt text | You | ☐ |
| CTA button/link | You | ☐ |
| UTM parameters | You | ☐ |
| Repurpose notes | You | ☐ |

## Why Notion over a spreadsheet?
- Quick filters and Kanban views without formulas.
- Easy to attach assets or reference briefs inline.
- Sharing with clients is one toggle away; permissions are simple.
