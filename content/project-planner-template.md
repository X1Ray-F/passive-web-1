title: "Project Planner Template (Notion/Sheets)"
description: Lightweight project planner with milestones, risks, and communication cadence for freelancers and SMBs.
slug: project-planner-template
section: freelance
---

A simple project planner keeps scope, deadlines, and communication in one place. This template works in Notion or Google Sheets and can be duplicated for each client engagement.

## Core tabs/sections
- Summary: goals, success metrics, stakeholders, comms cadence.
- Timeline: milestones, owners, due dates, status.
- Tasks: backlog with priority (P1–P3), effort, and dependencies.
- Risks: risk, impact, likelihood, mitigation, owner.
- Decisions/Notes: date-stamped decisions to avoid rehashing.

### Suggested columns

| Column | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task | Clear action | "Write landing page copy" |
| Owner | Person | You / Client PM |
| Priority | P1/P2/P3 | P1 |
| Effort | S/M/L | M |
| Due date | Date | 2026-02-21 |
| Status | Not started / In progress / Blocked / Done | In progress |
| Dependencies | Linked task | Waiting on brand kit |

## Milestone and billing alignment
- Align milestone dates with billing events: deposit, draft delivery, final handoff.
- Include a "client review by" date to keep feedback on time.
- If scope shifts, log a change request row and re-baseline dates visibly.

## Communication cadence
- Weekly update: 3 bullets (done, next, risks) + link to the planner.
- Daily standup (if short project): 2 minutes async; keep in planner comments.
- Escalation path: who can unblock and within what time.

## How to use the template
1) Duplicate the Notion or Sheets file; rename for the client.
2) Pre-fill milestones and dates; highlight critical path items.
3) Share view-only with the client; give comment access for clarifications.
4) Review weekly; close out risks/decisions to keep history clean.

## Add-on snippets
- "Definition of done" per deliverable: e.g., "Page live, Lighthouse 90+, tracking installed".
- QA checklist per milestone: links to device/browser checks.
- Payment reminder: "Invoices sent at milestone completion, net 14." 

## Example weekly update format (pasteable)
- **Done:** bullet list of what shipped and links.
- **Next:** top 3 tasks with due dates.
- **Risks/blockers:** owner + ask.
- **Decisions needed:** list and deadline.

## Simple risk matrix

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stakeholder slow reviews | High | Medium | Pre-book review slots; send reminders 48h before | PM |
| Missing assets (brand kit) | Medium | Medium | Request at kickoff; provide a placeholder kit | Design |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Use change request log; get written approval | Lead |

## Handoff checklist
- All deliverables linked in one “Final” section.
- Credentials transferred or access revoked if project ends.
- Invoices sent/paid; late fee clause reiterated if applicable.
- Lessons learned noted in the planner for future gigs.
