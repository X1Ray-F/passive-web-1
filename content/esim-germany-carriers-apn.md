Germany has strong 4G coverage and expanding 5G in cities. Travelers can pick eSIMs from local carriers or international resellers. Use the tables below to choose a carrier, set the APN, and avoid roaming surprises.

## Compatible carriers (tourist-friendly)
- Telekom (best rural coverage; solid 5G in major cities).
- Vodafone (wide LTE, growing 5G; good balance of speed/price).
- O2/Telefónica (best value; strongest in urban areas, weaker in remote regions).
- Resellers like Airalo, Nomad, Holafly ride these networks; they usually pick Telekom or O2.

### APN settings

| Network | APN | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telekom | `internet.telekom` or `internet.t-mobile` | Leave user/pass blank |
| Vodafone | `web.vodafone.de` | Set APN type `default,supl` |
| O2 | `internet` or `surfo2` | Works for most resellers |
| Reseller email says “set automatically” | Leave default | Only adjust if data won’t start |

## How to buy and activate
1) Purchase online from a reseller (QR code) or in-store at Telekom/Vodafone shops.
2) On iOS: Settings → Cellular → Add eSIM; on Android: Network → SIMs → Download a SIM.
3) Name the plan “Germany Data”; set it as data line; keep your home SIM for calls.
4) Enable data roaming for the eSIM; this is required even for domestic use on many plans.
5) If data stalls, reapply the APN above and toggle airplane mode once.

### Coverage tips
- Rural Bavaria and northern coasts: Telekom usually wins.
- Urban Berlin/Hamburg/Frankfurt: all three perform well; Vodafone often has strong 5G.
- Trains: expect drops in tunnels; download offline tickets/maps before boarding.

## Roaming and fair use
- EU/EEA residents using a German eSIM may hit “Roam Like at Home” fair-use limits; check data caps.
- Non-EU travelers: most reseller plans are purely data and avoid domestic FUP, but tethering may be throttled.

## Device notes
- iPhone XS and newer, Pixel 4+, Samsung S22/S23/S24 generally work; ensure your phone is unlocked.
- Dual-SIM: keep your home SIM active for calls/SMS; route data through the eSIM.
