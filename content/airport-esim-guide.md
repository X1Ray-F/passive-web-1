Buying an eSIM at the airport feels convenient, but online options are often cheaper and faster. Use this guide to decide where to buy, what to check before boarding, and how to activate without burning time at the gate.

## Airport vs. online: quick pros/cons

| Option | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Airport kiosk | Human help, local tips, may bundle voice/SMS | Higher prices, limited plan choices, queues |
| Airline Wi‑Fi purchase | Easy if offered in-app | Often pricier, may be region-locked |
| Online reseller (QR) | Buy anytime, competitive data bundles | Must trust your own setup; support via chat |

### When airport makes sense
- You need local voice minutes immediately (some kiosks sell mixed plans).
- You want an agent to confirm device compatibility on the spot.

### When online wins
- You already know your device is eSIM-ready and unlocked.
- You want to compare multiple networks (AT&T vs T-Mobile, Telekom vs O2).
- You prefer to preload the QR code before landing.

## Pre-flight checklist
- Confirm your phone is unlocked and supports eSIM in the destination country.
- Screenshot or print the QR code; avoid relying on inflight Wi‑Fi.
- Download offline maps for the arrival city.
- Keep a paperclip/SIM tool if you also plan to swap a physical SIM.

## Activation steps (generic)
1) On Wi‑Fi, open the QR code on another device or printed copy.
2) iOS: Settings → Cellular → Add eSIM. Android: Network → SIMs → Download a SIM.
3) Scan, name it “Trip Data”, set as data line, leave your home SIM for calls.
4) Turn on data roaming for the eSIM; keep it off for the home SIM.
5) Test with a maps search; if slow, toggle airplane mode once.

### Common pitfalls to avoid
- Forgetting to enable data roaming on the eSIM profile.
- Buying “unlimited” plans without checking fair-use speeds.
- Not knowing the APN; keep the provider email handy.
- Draining battery while troubleshooting—carry a small power bank.

## If you must queue at the airport
- Ask which underlying network the plan uses (matters for rural trips).
- Request the APN and fair-use policy in writing.
- Decline paid upsells for “priority speed” unless clearly documented.
