The UK has broad eSIM support across the big four networks and multiple travel resellers. Use this guide to pick a carrier, set the APN, and avoid roaming surprises on unlocked phones.

## Carrier options (Feb 2026)
- **EE** – Strong 5G in cities; good motorway coverage; hotspot allowed on most plans.
- **O2** – Solid urban coverage; generous EU roaming on many plans.
- **Vodafone** – Good balance of price and speed; strong in London/South East.
- **Three** – Competitive pricing; 5G growing; check fair-use abroad.
- **Resellers:** Airalo (O2/Vodafone), Holafly (Vodafone), Nomad (multi-network), Truphone (EE backbone).

### APN settings

| Network | APN | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EE | `everywhere` | Leave user/pass blank |
| O2 | `mobile.o2.co.uk` | APN type `default,supl` |
| Vodafone | `wap.vodafone.co.uk` or `internet` | Keep PAP/CHAP off unless required |
| Three | `three.co.uk` | Enable data roaming for MVNOs |
| Airalo/Nomad (UK packs) | Usually pushes automatically | Check confirmation email if data stalls |

## How to activate (iOS/Android)
1) Buy plan and open the QR on another screen.
2) iOS: Settings → Mobile Data → Add eSIM. Android: Network → SIMs → Download a SIM.
3) Scan, name it “UK Data”; set as data line; keep your home SIM for calls.
4) Turn on data roaming for the eSIM.
5) Enter APN above only if data doesn’t start within 1–2 minutes.

## Coverage and speed tips
- London/Manchester/Birmingham: all four have 5G; EE and Vodafone usually fastest.
- Rural Scotland/Wales: EE and Vodafone tend to hold LTE longer.
- Trains: expect tunnels/dead spots; cache tickets offline.

## Fair use and tethering
- Many “unlimited” eSIMs slow after ~50–100 GB; check fair-use in the email.
- Hotspot generally allowed on EE/Vodafone; some resellers limit it—test early.

## Pricing ballpark (traveler packs, Feb 2026)
- 3–5 GB / 7–10 days: £6–£10 via resellers.
- 10–20 GB / 15–30 days: £12–£20.
- “Unlimited” 15–30 days: £22–£32 with 2–3 Mbps FUP after heavy use.

## Device compatibility reminders
- iPhone XS or newer, Pixel 4+, Samsung S22/S23/S24 work reliably; ensure the phone is unlocked.\n- Dual-SIM: set UK eSIM as data only; leave home SIM for calls/SMS.\n- Older budget Androids may lack band 32/42 used for 4G+ in some areas—expect slower speeds.\n\n## Quick troubleshooting\n- Data not starting: toggle airplane mode; reapply APN; ensure data roaming is on for the eSIM.\n- Slow in stadiums/events: switch to 4G temporarily; 5G cells can saturate.\n- Hotspot blocked: some resellers detect heavy tethering—limit streaming and use lower video resolutions.\n\n## Airport vs online purchase\n- Heathrow/Gatwick kiosks sell Vodafone/EE eSIMs at a premium. If you want human help, it’s fine; otherwise buy online before you land to skip queues.\n- Online QR works as soon as you have Wi‑Fi; activate in the hotel or on airport Wi‑Fi before heading out.\n\n---\n*** End Patch
