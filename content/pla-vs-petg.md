PLA and PETG are the most common filaments for hobby and prototyping. Choose based on strength, heat resistance, finish, and how much tuning you want to do. This guide highlights when to pick each, with nozzle and bed temperature ranges for quick setup.

## Quick take
- PLA: easiest to print, great surface finish, lower heat resistance.
- PETG: tougher, more temperature tolerant, slightly stringier without tuning.

### Comparison table

| Feature | PLA | PETG |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nozzle temp | 195–210°C | 230–245°C |
| Bed temp | 50–60°C | 70–85°C |
| Bed adhesion | Blue tape, PEI, glue stick (optional) | PEI or glass; light glue helps release |
| Strength | Good | Very good |
| Heat resistance | ~55°C softening | ~80°C softening |
| Ease of printing | Very easy | Moderate; watch for stringing |
| Finish | Matte/satin | Glossy; can show zits if retractions off |

## When to choose PLA
- Visual prototypes, miniatures, brackets that won’t see heat.
- Fast prints without an enclosure.
- When you need crisp detail and minimal post-processing.

## When to choose PETG
- Parts in warm environments (cars, sunlight, near electronics).
- Functional prints needing impact resistance (brackets, mounts).
- Outdoor use where humidity changes; PETG absorbs less moisture than PLA.

### Tuning tips for PETG
- Increase retraction slightly vs PLA; start at 0.6–0.8 mm direct drive, 4–6 mm Bowden.
- Lower print speed to 40–50 mm/s to reduce stringing.
- Turn on “combing within infill” and wipe/nozzle coast if your slicer supports it.
- Add a light glue stick layer on PEI to make parts release without tearing the sheet.

## Storage and drying
- PLA: store in a dry box or resealable bag with desiccant; dries quickly at ~45°C.
- PETG: more moisture-resistant but still benefits from drying at 60°C for a few hours.

## Real-world examples
- PLA: desktop organizers, cosplay parts painted later, display stands.
- PETG: car vent clips, camera mounts, brackets near PCs or routers, outdoor signage.
