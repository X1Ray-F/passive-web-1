description: A reusable quote/estimate template with scope, pricing, and validity terms.

Great quotes set expectations, speed approvals, and prevent scope creep. Use this template to present pricing for fixed-fee or hourly work and clarify what happens if scope changes.

## What the template covers
- Project overview and goals in two sentences.
- Deliverables list with inclusions/exclusions.
- Pricing model (fixed, hourly, or milestone) and currency.
- Timeline and key dates (kickoff, draft, review, launch).
- Assumptions and client responsibilities.
- Validity window and acceptance terms.

### Suggested structure

| Section | What to include | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | One-liner goal | "Landing page redesign to lift signups" |
| Deliverables | Bullets, max 6 | Wireframe, copy draft, final build |
| Pricing | Fixed fee or rate x hours | $1,800 fixed (includes 2 revision rounds) |
| Timeline | Milestones/dates | Draft 2/20, Final 2/28 |
| Assumptions | Access, assets, review speed | Client supplies brand kit; 48h feedback |
| Validity | Expiry and acceptance | Valid 10 days; 30% deposit to book slot |

## Fixed-fee vs hourly
- **Fixed-fee** when scope is clear and you control the process; include revision limits.
- **Hourly** when scope is evolving; show an estimate range and cap with pre-approval.
- **Hybrid**: fixed base + hourly change requests after sign-off.

## Clauses to copy-paste
- **Late approval:** “Pricing assumes approvals within 2 business days; delays may shift the timeline.”
- **Out-of-scope:** “Work not listed above will be quoted separately at $X/hr with prior approval.”
- **Payment:** “30% deposit to start, 40% at draft, 30% at delivery. Net 14.”

## Tips to close faster
- Add 1–2 relevant portfolio links right under the overview.
- State your availability window (e.g., “Can start next Monday; delivery by Feb 28”).
- Include a lightweight CTA: link to your PayPal button for deposit or a calendar link for quick calls.

## Numbers to keep handy
- Typical rush fee: 20–30% for <72h turnarounds—state it upfront.
- Revision rounds: include 2 as standard; extra rounds billed hourly.
- Validity: 7–14 days keeps pricing current if costs move.

## How to deliver the quote
- Export to PDF to avoid accidental edits; keep a shareable Doc link for fast updates.
- Add your PayPal.me link plus bank details in the footer so clients can pay the deposit immediately.
- Include a signature block: “Accepted by ___ / Date ___” for quick sign-off.

## After acceptance
- Send an invoice referencing the quote number and payment schedule.
- Move items into your project planner and content calendar templates to keep execution tight.
- Log decision date and scope in your CRM row so you can track conversion and follow-up cadence.

## FAQ (quick answers)
- **Can I send a rough quote first?** Yes—mark it “budgetary” and follow with a firm quote once scope is locked.
- **What if the client wants unlimited revisions?** Convert to hourly after the included rounds; state the rate in the quote.
- **Should I list discounts?** Only if time-bound; otherwise it becomes your new default price.
