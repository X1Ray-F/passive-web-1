Freelancers bill faster when the invoice is clear, consistent, and ready to send in under two minutes. This page gives you a copy-paste invoice template, shows the essential sections, and explains how to handle taxes, late fees, and payment terms without sounding pushy.

## When this template is perfect
- You bill hourly or per project and want clean totals with tax shown separately.
- You need space for PO numbers or client references without bloating the layout.
- You send invoices to both SMBs and larger procurement teams that expect clear terms.
- You want something you can duplicate in Google Docs, Word, or a PDF generator.

## Core sections to include
- Header with your logo/name, business ID, and contact email/phone.
- Client block (company, contact, billing address) and optional project code.
- Invoice metadata: invoice number, issue date, due date, currency.
- Line items: description, quantity or hours, rate, subtotal.
- Taxes/withholding: VAT or sales tax lines; optional reverse-charge note.
- Totals and how to pay: PayPal.me link, bank transfer, or card link.
- Notes: late fee clause, scope reminder, thanks.

### Quick field reference

| Section | Fields to fill | Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header | Logo/name, registration, email, phone | Keep your email first for replies |
| Invoice meta | Invoice #, issue date, due date, currency | Use YYYYMMDD-001 format |
| Line items | Description, qty/hrs, rate, subtotal | Add task IDs if client uses tickets |
| Taxes | Tax name %, amount | Specify if VAT reverse charge applies |
| Totals | Subtotal, tax, discounts, grand total | Match currency with contract |

## Late fee clause (copy-paste)
> Payment is due within 14 days of the issue date. Late payments may incur a 1.5% monthly fee. Work may pause until balances are cleared.

## How to use the template
1) Duplicate the file into Google Docs or Word; save a PDF export preset.
2) Pre-fill your business info, currency, and default payment terms.
3) Keep a running invoice number list so numbering never collides.
4) Add your PayPal link (paypal.me/FlaviusEduard98) in the payment section plus bank details if needed.
5) Send as PDF; avoid editable formats to reduce accidental edits.

### Example line items

| Description | Qty/Hrs | Rate | Subtotal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web landing page build | 12 hrs | $55 | $660 |
| Copy updates & QA | 5 hrs | $55 | $275 |
| Monthly hosting (prepaid) | 1 | $25 | $25 |

## Mini checklist before sending
- Totals match the contract currency and include tax notes.
- Due date set to 7–14 days; shorter for rush projects.
- Files named `client-invoice-YYYYMMDD.pdf`.
- A short thank-you sentence at the end to keep tone friendly.
