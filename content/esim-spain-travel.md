Spain has strong LTE and growing 5G in major cities. You can choose a local carrier eSIM or a travel reseller that rides Movistar, Vodafone, or Orange. Here’s how to pick, activate, and keep data running smoothly across cities and islands.

## Quick picks (Feb 2026)
- Best balance of price + coverage: **Airalo “BonBon” (Movistar)** 5–20 GB packs.
- City speed: **Vodafone-backed plans** often deliver the fastest 5G in Madrid/Barcelona.
- Islands (Canary/Balearic): **Movistar/Orange** generally stronger than Vodafone in rural spots.

### APN and carriers

| Carrier/Reseller | Underlying network | APN | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Movistar | Movistar | `telefonica.es` or `movistar.es` | Leave user/pass blank |
| Orange | Orange | `orangeworld` | May auto-provision |
| Vodafone ES | Vodafone | `ac.vodafone.es` | Set APN type `default,supl` |
| Airalo Spain | Movistar | Auto | Only set manually if data stalls |
| Holafly Spain | Movistar/Orange | Auto | Check email for overrides |
| Nomad Spain | Vodafone/Movistar | Auto | Good backup on dual networks |

## Activation steps
1) Buy plan; open QR on another device.
2) iOS: Settings → Mobile Data → Add eSIM. Android: Network → SIMs → Download a SIM.
3) Name it “Spain Data”; set as data line; keep home SIM for calls.
4) Turn on data roaming for the eSIM; wait 1–2 minutes.
5) Enter APN only if data does not start; reboot once if needed.

## Coverage notes by destination
- **Barcelona/Madrid/Valencia:** 5G widely available; any network works.
- **Andalusia + coastal drives:** Movistar/Orange have more consistent LTE between towns.
- **Remote hikes (Pyrenees, islands):** cache maps; expect LTE drop-offs—Movistar best chance.

## Fair use and tethering
- Many “unlimited” travel plans apply 2–3 Mbps FUP after heavy use; choose a 10–20 GB capped plan for predictable speeds.
- Hotspot usually allowed; test early.

## Troubleshooting
- If speeds crawl, toggle airplane mode; switch to 3G/4G temporarily in crowded areas.
- SIM not allowed? Confirm phone is unlocked; older budget devices may lack band 20 (800 MHz) used in rural areas.

## Price guide (Feb 2026)
- 3 GB / 7–10 days: €6–€8 via resellers.\n- 10 GB / 15–30 days: €12–€18.\n- Unlimited* / 15 days: €27–€35 (*fair-use throttles after heavy use).\n\n## Airport vs online\n- Madrid/Barcelona airports sell Orange/Vodafone eSIMs at kiosks; expect higher prices but in-person help.\n- Online QR from Airalo/Nomad is usually cheaper; activate on airport Wi‑Fi before leaving arrivals.\n\n## Device checks\n- iPhone XS+, Pixel 4+, Samsung S22/S23/S24 fully supported; ensure unlocked.\n- Dual-SIM: keep home SIM for calls; eSIM for data with roaming on.\n- If tethering fails, set APN type to `default,dun` on Android.\n\n---\n*** End Patch
